\section{Introduction}
Consider the standard $5\times 6$ board in PAD. If you apply a rainbow board refresh (assuming all six standard orbs are equally probable), what is the probability of $i$ matches (including skyfalls), for $i\in\N$?

This is a deceptively hard problem. I hope there is a nice closed form solution, but there probably isn't since it seems to involve partitioning.

Consider the problem with skyfalls disabled.
This limits the number of matches to $i=0,1,\dots,10$.

Simplify the problem down even more, now it's the $5\times 4$ board. In this case we only have $6^{5\times 4}/6!$ boards to consider, and only $i=0,1,\dots,6$ combos to consider.

To consider skyfalls, we may consider the boards as states of a Markov chain. The expected 

\section{$2\times2$ board with 2-matches}
Consider a simplification of the problem:
The board is now $2 \times 2$, and a match occurs when at least two orbs are adjacent to each other.

It is possible to enumerate all of the $6^4=1296$ possible boards.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 combos
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each of the four orbs are distinct colors, so there are $\binom{6}{4}\cdot 4!=360$ boards
        \item Two of the four orbs are the same color. In order to avoid matches, the two same-colored orbs are diagonal from each other. Therefore there are two possibilities.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            a & b \\
            \hline
            c & a \\
            \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \qquad
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            b & a \\
            \hline
            a & c \\
            \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        This results in $2\cdot\binom{6}{3}\cdot 3!=240$ boards.
        \item Two orbs are the same color and the remaining two orbs are both a different color. To avoid matches, the same-color pairs must be diagonal from each other, and there is only a single case. This results in $\binom{6}{2}\cdot 2!=30$ boards.
    \end{itemize}
    In total, the probability of 0 combos is $(360+240+30)/1296=35/72$.
    \item 1 combo
    
    \item 2 combo
    
\end{itemize}
