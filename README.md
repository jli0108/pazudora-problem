# pazudora-problem

i want to figure out the exact distributions of the number of combos on any given rectangular board...

simulation can be found at https://jli0108.github.io/pazudora-simulation/

this is a very interesting combinatorial/probability problem:

if you change the number of orbs required for a match, the distribution changes (obviously!)

if you change the board size, the distribution changes (obviously...)

if you change the number of colors, the distribution changes (obviously?)

if anyone happens to read this and has any insight, please let me know!!!!
